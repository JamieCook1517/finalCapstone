## Installation

Copy the URL of this repository, then go to your IDE (Visual Studio Code highly recommended) and run a new terminal on an appropriate directory. On your terminal type **git clone _repository URL_** and press ENTER. This will add the repo to your directory. Once you have changed the directory to the newly added folder the program is ready for use.

## Usage

Before using the program make sure that on VSCode you are using at least the basic Python extension so that you can click on the 'play' icon on the top right of the below image to run the code.

Once the program is run it will first tell you to enter your username and then your password. A default username called 'admin' and a default password called 'password' are available which you can use to enter into the respective username and password prompts. Once you are logged in you will encounter a series of options.
